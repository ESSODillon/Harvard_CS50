# Harvard_CS50

As a mid-level developer, I’ve spent years working with JavaScript, PHP, and React—building real-world applications and solving complex problems. But great developers don’t just learn new frameworks; they **deepen their understanding of core computer science concepts** to improve how they think and solve problems.

That’s why I decided to take **Harvard’s CS50**—not because I’m lacking fundamentals, but because I see **huge value in reinforcing them**. The better I understand **algorithms, data structures, and low-level programming**, the better I can write scalable, efficient, and optimized code.

💡 **How this benefits me:**

✔️ **Stronger problem-solving skills** – Thinking more critically about performance, scalability, and efficiency.

✔️ **Better adaptability** – Learning new technologies becomes easier when you have a strong foundation.

✔️ **Long-term career growth** – Staying sharp in CS concepts helps me take on bigger challenges in software architecture and beyond.

I see this as an investment in myself, my work, and my future. If you’ve taken CS50 or have thoughts on revisiting the fundamentals, I’d love to hear your experience!
